# Pendulum-Simulation

# About :book:
This is a simple project for the sake of learning the basics of the OpenGL API.

# Dependencies
- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) for creating windows and input handling
- [GLAD](https://glad.dav1d.de/) for rendering in OpenGL
- [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h) for loading textures
- [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) library for handling maths

# Credits and Thank you's :star_struck:
### I have referenced several videos and websites for this project. I would like to credit and thank the following sources:

- Huge shout out to [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw) for the [Simple Pendulum Simulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBWMtlbbOag) video!
The math and logic in my project came from this video. (I really just copied the calculations made in the video entirely :zipper_mouth_face:). Since my goal for this project is to 
learn OpenGL I did not want to spend too much time on the logistics of how to get the pendulum to behave. I will, however, need to sort out the logic for an imteractive pendulum on
my own.
